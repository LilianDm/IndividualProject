# Letter Quest - Individual Project
## Created and coded by Lilian Dmitrieva
### Info about the game
#### Letter Quest is an OOP Graphical Game with keyboard/mouse listeners. It is a twist on the classic game "Hangman" coded in the processing app. You play as a 'Letter Legend' seeking to save the people of Syntaxia from the villanious 'Scriptorus Darkscribe'. You only have 7 tries to save the people, so be careful with your letter choices. With colorful backgrounds and interesting stories, you're bound to have a fun time with Letter Quest!
### Project Objectives
* Graphical start and background screen that moves
* Multiple random words to have guessed
* Hangman that increases when there are more incorrect guesses
* Mouse and Key detections
* End game when 7 incorrect guesses OR correctly guessed word
