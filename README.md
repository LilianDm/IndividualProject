# Letter Quest - Individual Project
## Created and coded by Lilian Dmitrieva
### Info about the game
#### Letter Quest is a twist on the classic game "Hangman" coded in the processing app. You play as a 'Letter Legend' seeking to save the people of Syntaxia from the villanious 'Scriptorus Darkscribe'. You only have 5 tries to save the people, so be careful with your letter choices. With colorful backgrounds and interesting stories, you're bound to have a fun time with Letter Quest!
### Project Objectives
* Graphical start and end screen that moves
